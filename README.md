# SSL-Enabled Jupyter Notebook (CentOS 7)

This is a containerized distribution of Jupyter Notebook by Louisiana State University 
Coastal Resilience Collaboratory (https://crc.cct.lsu.edu/). This image is to enable
an embedded web page with iframe as https host can not embed http site. More about 
Jupyter project itself can be found at [Jupyter Official Site](http://jupyter.org/).

## Spinning up Jupyter container

On **Linux** 

    $ docker run --rm -it -p 9999:9999 -v "$(pwd):/notebooks" lsucrc/notebook

then Visit `https://localhost:9999/` with your favourite web browser. All notebooks from your session will be saved in the current directory.

On other platforms, such as **Windows and OS X**, that use
[`docker-machine`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) with `docker`, a container can be started using
`docker-machine`. In the browser, open the URL `http://ip:8888/` where `ip` is
the IP address returned from the command [`docker-machine ip <MACHINE>`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/ip/):

    $ docker-machine ip <MACHINE>
